== Description ==

> Does one thing: disables the Widget Block Editor feature.

Activate this plugin to disable the Widget Block Editor functionality (added in WP version 5.8). To re-enable the widget block editor at any time, simply deactivate the plugin.


**Features**

* Simple to use - activate and done.
* No permanent modifications are performed.
* There are no configuration options to worry about.
* Easy peasy.

**Why is this useful?**

WordPress 5.8 was launched on July 20, 2021, and contained some enhancements to the WordPress block editor. Among those features was an introduction to WordPress's new Widget Block Editor.

Now, why would you want to deactivate this function in the first place? You may have script conflicts that prevent you from using the widgets due to the block editor and conflicts with other plugins.


**Privacy**

This plugin does not collect or store any information about the user. It does not use cookies or link to any third-party websites. Thus, this plugin has no effect on the user's privacy.


== Installation ==

**Installing the plugin**

Activate as you would any other plugin and you're done. There are no configuration options; it operates automatically.

**Uninstalling**

To uninstall/remove the plugin, go to the Plugins page and deactivate before deleting it. This plugin does not modify the WordPress database in any way.



== Upgrade Notice ==

To update this plugin, uninstall the previous version and install the new one. Alternatively, you can just click "Update" from the Plugins tab and WordPress will take care of it for you automatically.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is there an "Undo" to reverse the disable?**

Yes, just disable the plugin. Without the plugin, WordPress will revert to its original state of the widget block editor.


**Got a question?**

Send any questions or feedback in the support section.
